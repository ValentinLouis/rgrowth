# Rgrowth
Post-disturbance regrowth monitoring using Landsat Time Series (LTS).

`bfastSpatial` is required for `Rgrowth`. Both can be installed using `devtools`:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('dutri001/bfastSpatial')
install_github('bendv/Rgrowth')
library(Rgrowth)
```

A short tutorial is available [here](http://bendv.github.io/Rgrowth). At the moment, the tutorial only covers single-pixel time series. Check back later for updates to the tutorial, including a mapping component!
